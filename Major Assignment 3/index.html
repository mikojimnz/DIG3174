                    <hr>

                    <p>As a freshman going into high school, I was required to take at least 2 semesters worth of art classes. I selected Digital Media I &amp; II.</p>
                    <p>In those classes I was taught how to use Photoshop to manipulate images and create basic graphics. I started to take an interest in graphic design and photography.</p>
                    <p><i>In the end I decide to continue by taking the photography course in my sophomore year.</i></p>
                    <p>Looking back at the images I had taken then, they were pretty terrible. But, I did manage to win 2nd my entry in our school's fall art show.</p>

                    <p>Before entering sophomore year, I was invited to join our school's Leadership Team. This gave me some valuable leadership positions, but it ultimately allowed me to put into practice what I had learned.</p>
                    <p>In that summer leading up to the start of the school year, the existing media production club had disbanded and the club sponsor left the school.</p>
                    <p>The leadership advisor asked for a group of people to put together the freshman orientation video but no one stepped up. In the end I got roped in for knowing "technology". The group of students and I were walking into unknown territory but in the end we managed to pull through.</p>
                    <p>In succeeding with that small project, I was ultimately given the opportunity to manage and direct the all of the organization's video needs. This included all the major affairs including homecoming, prom, and the talent show.</p>
                    <p>My time working with the leadership team helped me to grow, not only in my knowledge of the Creative Cloud Suite, but also as a someone who could lead others in group activities.</p>

                    <h2>Stepping Out of the Box</h2>
                    <hr>

                    <p>At the end of my sophomore year, after already taking photography class and working my first year with the leadership team, I decided to join the yearbook staff. It would prove to be the biggest and most challenging undertaking I would have ever encountered.</p>
                    <p>As a 1st year reporter, I was given the opportunity to sharpen my photography skills with athletic photos and candid shots. I also learned a myriad of skills from investigative journalism, networking with different people, meeting real-world working deadlines, and selling a product.</p>
                    <p>Our staff is very small compared to other high schools. Because I had taken the 3 digital art classes, all taught by the same teacher who advises the yearbook staff, I was promoted to double as the sole design artist for the book. I learned to create page layouts and optimize my graphic design workflow for mass projects.</p>

                    <p>While pursuing my creative interests through yearbook, <i>I kept an eye on my future career paths by taking up computer science classes in my junior and senior years.</i></p>
                    <p>I learned to code in Java and a little bit of C#. We create games in Unity and learned 3D modeling in Blender. Out of class I played with fake programs and made mock websites.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately I wanted to take up being a photographer as my main career. But acting pragmatically, I wanted to have a path to fall back on. At the very least I could be a photographer as a side hobby.</p>

                    <p>From the opportunities and knowledge afforded to me by being on the yearbook staff, I decided to take on becoming a freelance photographer seriously.</p>
                    <p><i>It was at this point where I started to draw up how I would market myself and create my branding.</i></p>
                    <p>Armed with the understanding of how to design page layouts, I applied my skills to designing my first website. I specifically chose not to use a website builder because I wanted to have full control over the design and function of my website.</p>
                    <p>In making my first full website, I had learned how to operate web hosting services, manage IPs and issue SSL certificates. I picked up how to program in JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Additionally, I learned how to handle clients need and meet their expectations.</p>

                    <p>Entering my final year of high school meant that I would receive senior roles on the yearbook staff. In fact I was given three editorial roles, student life copy editor, co-athletics copy editor, and most importantly design editor. I was given the most roles out of all the staff, including the editor-in-chief.</p>
                    <p>As design editor, I was given full reign, with the input from the other editors, over the design and execution of that year's theme from cover to cover.</p>
                    <p>While being design editor allowed me to put everything I had learn up until then into full display, I gained some new insights about the world as a senior about to graduate high school.</p>
                    <p><i>I started to care more about the little things in life and view photography as a tool for introspection.</i></p>

                    <p>By the time it was time for colleges, <i>I only ever had UCF on my mind.</i></p>
                    <p>Well I hadn't really put any other thought to other colleges because I had always grown up here in Orlando with UCF right in my backyard, just a few minutes from home.</p>
                    <p>If I had to say give a proper answer of why I chose this place, I would say it was because of the great computer science program I kept hearing about and the many opportunities that UCF had to offer.</p>
                    <p>I was accepted in Fall 2018 and started working towards a degree in computer science and minor in digital media.</p>

                    <p>Well past the drop/swap deadline in spring of 2019, I decided to switch majors from computer science to digital media.</p>
                    <p>I was getting frustrated with the higher and abstract concepts of math. I felt that this was not the career path I wanted to go with for the rest of my life.</p>
                    <p><i>I chose to take on digital media - web design track because I saw an opportunity to utilize both my talents as a digital artist and as a savvy front end developer.</i></p>
                    <p>After two more semester, I was sure that I had made the right call to switch. The intricate dance between art and technology felt familiar and exciting while advancing in more complex subjects.</p>
