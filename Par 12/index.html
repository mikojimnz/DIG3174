    <h1>Participation Week 12: Font Creation</h1>
    <p>Normally when choosing fonts for my website I use the font Raleway and its different weights. I like to using san-serif fonts because I like to create a clean and minimalistic look across all my web pages.</p>
    <p>For this assignment, I switched it up and created a serf font. From many prior instructors, I've heard its better to use serif fonts for blocks of text such as this for improved readability.</p>
    <p>I wanted this font to still look sharp in a sense so I choose to make it have narrow and slim features. Additionally, it is slanted to give it more of an accented look. Overall I think it avoids the cheesy and dated look of most serif fonts while still maintaining a modern aesthetic.</p>
